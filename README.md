# Go API REST Example

Based on [Francesco Ciulla Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLVJY-1dKz8)

I added/changed a few things

- [x] A server struct contains db and router. To make the mock easier.
- [x] unit test with sqlmock.
- [x] Dockerfile multistage.
- [x] gitignore.


Run test

    go test
